This is an open source reimplementation of `R2RLIVE.dll` by Team R2R.

Like `R2RLIVE.dll`, this script uses Team R2R's signing key only.

This script is not the result of reverse engineering Ableton Live, and the output of this script **will not** circumvent the protection on an unmodified copy of Ableton Live.
